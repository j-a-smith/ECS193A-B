## Local Co-Op/Vs Zomibe Base Defense Shooter(Name Pending)
The goal of this project is to create an IOS AR game using
ARKit. The game will be a "base defense" type of game where a 
base is set up and the user must defend it from the incoming
waves of zombies that atempt to destroy the base. Through the
phones camera the user will be able to see the base and zombies
and use the crosshairs on the phone screen to take enemies down.
The game is over once the base is destroyed. Muliplayer 
funcionality will be added to allow two players to play together.
